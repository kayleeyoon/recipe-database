	('Yorkshire Pudding', 'English', 'Beat the eggs together in a mixing bowl using a balloon whisk. Sift the flour with the salt, then gradually beat this into the eggs to make a smooth batter. Whisk in the milk until combined. Cover and leave to stand at room temperature for about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/Gas 7. Put 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil into each compartment of two 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins (see Tip). If you only have one tin, you’ll have to do this in two batches. Place the tin in the oven for 12–15 minutes to heat up the oil and tins until very hot. This is important for the rise. Stir the batter and pour into a jug. At the oven (this is safer than carrying a tin of hot oil across the kitchen), carefully pour some batter into the middle of the oil in each hole, remembering that it is very hot. Watch out as the oil will sizzle a bit as the batter hits it. Put the tins straight back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes or until the Yorkshires are well risen, golden brown and crisp. Serve immediately with Roast Beef with gravy and all the trimmings.', 5, 15, 40, 15, 'Gordon Ramsay', 'Website'),
	('Teriyaki Salmon', 'Japanese', 'Put the ginger and garlic into a bowl and mix with the soy sauce, maple syrup, mirin and a drizzle of olive oil. Place the salmon fillets in a dish, season with salt and pepper and pour the sticky dressing over them. Cover with cling film and set aside in the fridge to marinate for up to 2 hours, but at least 20 minutes. Place a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a dash of oil. When hot, add the salmon, skin side down, reserving the marinade. Cook for 2 minutes, then pour in the reserved marinade and cook for a further minute or so, until the salmon fillets are opaque halfway up the sides. Turn them over and cook on the other side for 3–4 minutes, basting with the sauce so that the salmon is well coated. Add a splash of water if the sauce is too thick. Serve the salmon fillets on individual plates, spooning over any teriyaki sauce left in the pan.', 8, 5, 60, 4, 'Gordon Ramsay', 'Website'),

Put the potatoes into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix them for a few seconds on low speed, to break them up. Slowly add the hot cream and butter to the potatoes, mixing on the lowest speed the last quarter of the cream and butter should be folded in by hand. Fold in the sour cream, Parmesan cheese, the remaining salt, and pepper; taste for seasoning and serve immediately. If the potatoes are too thick, add more hot cream and butter.', 7, 35, 15, 8, 'Food Network', 'Website'),
	('Lemon Sorbet', 'Italian', 'Finely grate the lemon zest into a pan, add the sugar and 250ml cold water, and warm over a low heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, returning half the lemon zest to the liquid (discarding the rest). Squeeze in the lemon juice, catching any pips in your fingers. Stir well, allow to cool slightly, then chill in the freezer for around 30 minutes, before removing. Transfer to an ice cream machine and churn until it’s the texture of sorbet. Pop it into a plastic container and freeze for 2 hours to firm up, before serving.', 2, 0, 120, 10, 'Jamie Oliver', 'Website');
